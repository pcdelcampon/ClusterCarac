\description{
Customer-level attributes and churn flag from a Vodafone churn study. The goal
is to estimate churn probability, uncover the factors that drive it, and
translate those insights into actionable retention and loyalty strategies
for marketing, sales, and product teams.
}
\details{
The churn (attrition) problem aims to explain why and when a customer leaves a
service. This dataset is used to identify key churn indicators, quantify their
impact, segment risk profiles, and propose targeted retention tactics for
marketing and sales teams. It also supports model validation, benchmarking of
intervention strategies over time, and crafting data-backed business cases for
customer success initiatives.
