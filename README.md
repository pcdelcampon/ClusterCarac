# ClusterCarac

ClusterCarac is an R package designed to describe and characterize groups or classes resulting from classification or clustering analyses. It can work with both qualitative and quantitative variables, although it currently supports only qualitative variables.

Install directly from GitHub (simplest current option):

``` r
install.packages("remotes")  # if you don't have it
remotes::install_github("pcdelcampon/ClusterCarac")
```
